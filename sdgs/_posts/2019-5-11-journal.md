Yesterday, I scheduled my second chat for the SDGs. Yipee!

On Tuesday, I'll be talking to
[Saadya Windauer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saadya-windauer-28b24434/)
from
[Open Knowledge Foundation Germany](https://www.okfn.de/en/)
about their project
[2030 Watch](https://www.2030-watch.de/).
She already informed me that the project is no longer
being maintained.
I'm very curious to learn why and what impact the project has had.

The other exciting piece of news is that I'll be going to an SDG
event called
[Festival der Taten ("festival of action")](https://17ziele.de/artikel/detail/festival-der-taten.html).
It brings together 500 participants aged 18-35 to ideate
and prototype solutions to the SDGs.
Happens on May 21 & 22 and I'm already super excited!

As this concludes my first week of SDG outreach,
here are the top highlights.
