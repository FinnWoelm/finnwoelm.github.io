Yesterday, I enrolled in a MOOC called
[*How to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals*](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-achieve-the-sustainable-development-goals).

The course was initially offered in the Fall of last year, but it is still available
for self-paced, free auditing.

So far, I have finished the first of seven modules. I learned about:

1. **History of the SDGs**: More on that soon!
1. **Analyzing SDG progress and identifying gaps**: Turns out that the course
instructor, Jeffrey Sachs, is the director of the [*Sustainable Development
Solutions Network (SDSN)*](http://unsdsn.org/) &mdash; the organization that's the
driving force behind the annual [SDG Index & Dashboard](https://www.sdgindex.org/)
(I talked about that in the last post). I've made a mental note about both
Jeffrey Sachs and the SDSN. They seem to be key players in the SDG movement.
1. **Decision-making &amp; leadership**: The SDG movement has no official
leadership structure. It's completely bottom-up. Jeffrey Sachs compares the
movement to an orchestra without a conductor &mdash; which, you know,
[is actually a thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0rAJiOleo).

I'm left wondering whether not having a conductor for the SDGs is a good thing.
I am a little worried that it makes it difficult to approach the SDGs in a
systematic fashion.

I'll need to ask Jeffrey Sachs about that.
