Yesterday, I stumbled upon two very interesting SDG data initiatives: [TReNDS](https://www.sdsntrends.org/) and [Global Partnerships for Sustainable Development Data](http://www.data4sdgs.org/)

TReNDS assists governments with data collection for the SDGs. One of their
new projects is focused on collecting real-time SDG data. For example, they plan
to look at satellite imagery to estimate population sizes: The amount
of light (area and intensity) that can be seen in a community at night indicates
population size.

It reminds me of something I read today:
> A nonprofit artificial intelligence firm called WattTime is going to use
 satellite imagery to precisely track the air pollution (including carbon
 emissions) coming out of every single power plant in the world, in real time.
 And itâ€™s going to make the data public.  
 *&mdash; [Vox: Air pollution from every single power plant in the world, tracked](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/5/7/18530811/global-power-plants-real-time-pollution-data).*

 They are currently looking for collaborators to help them identify what data
 might be estimated from satellite imagery and other real-time data sources.
 If you know someone, [reach out to them](https://www.sdsntrends.org/blog/2019/2/4/real-time-data-sdgs-project)! They are friendly :) I know because they already
 replied to my email from yesterday.

The other data initiative, the Global Partnerships for Sustainable Development
Data, is a network of 300+ members (organizations, governments, institutions, ...).
Sounds like *THE* place to go
if one has questions about SDG data or wants to get involved in some capacity.

I plan to reach out to the Global Partnerships for Sustainable Development Data,
too. But first [I want to read their Five Year Strategy from 2019-2023](https://trello.com/c/DzR7QpvT/22-resource-sdg4data-5-year-strategy). It may give me a
good impression of the current challenges. And it may give me hints as who to
talk to.
