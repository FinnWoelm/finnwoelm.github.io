I scheduled my first chat on the SDGs!! Yay üòÅ  
It's with
[Guillaume Lafortune](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaume-lafortune-91816a91/)
&mdash; project manager for the
[SDG Index & Dashboards Report](https://www.sdgindex.org/).
We will
be talking on Friday, May 17.

My efforts to connect with the Bertelsmann Foundation have not proven fruitful
just yet. The two people I contacted are very busy and did not seem open to
chat. I can totally understand that. They [are currently preparing the 2019 SDG Index report](http://unsdsn.org/news/2019/04/29/public-consultation-on-2019-sustainable-development-report-launched/)
and have a lot going.

But I stumbled upon [a (German) paper by the Bertelsmann Foundation
on SDG metrics for German cities](https://trello.com/c/3d9PntL7/27-resource-sdg-indicators-for-communities-cities-german).
I'll read through that and see if it gives me some new Bertelsmann Foundation
members to connect with (its authors, for example).

Other than that, I found lots of new
[resources](https://trello.com/b/tprftOO7/tasks) and a few more amazing
[initiatives](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JTB4FZd15uiAlJxmcVzIFKSzMK6hcJ6WmLlT0SBNrgo/edit#gid=0):
