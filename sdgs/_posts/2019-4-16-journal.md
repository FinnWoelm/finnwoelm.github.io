I have decided to start by first looking at how we are tracking progress on
the Sustainable Development Goals.

I started on the [UN's website on tracking progress towards the SDGs](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/monitoring-and-progress-hlpf/). However, the site is disappointingly... empty.
It boils down to a mention of Voluntary National Reviews for countries to
self-report on progress towards achievement of the SDGs.

These Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) are quite interesing. As I'm writing this, [there
are 182 of these reviews, all publicly available](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/vnrs/).
(North Korea has announced that [they will be conducting such a voluntary review in 2020](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/21259dprk_letter_to_ECOSOC_on_VNRs_at_HLPF_2020.pdf).

But these reviews are long and it's time-intensive to extract information on
SDG achievement from them. Not the best way to track SDG progress. But a fantastic
resource for a super close-up review of an individual country. They will be a
good resource to return back to when looking at the specific obstacles in each
country.

I then turned to DuckDuckGo. A search for "sustainable development goals progress"
led me to [sdg-tracker.org](https://sdg-tracker.org/). Apparently, the first
and only website to track progress on the SDGs:

> [We] built this SDG Trackerâ€”the first project of its kind to track the
> latest data across all of the 17 SDGs [...]
> This seemed like a crucial project to launch. Yet no other organisation to
> date has launched a similar platform.  
> &mdash; [About Page](https://sdg-tracker.org/about)

For each goal, they list its indicators and then an interactive graph next to it.
The graph gives a good idea of progress over time. Although, it would have been
nice to show a target line. There's also a map view as seen below.

Everything is organized by goal and indicator, **not** by country. That makes it
difficult to see who is and who is not on track to achieve the SDGs.

The people behind sdg-tracker have also researched which
indicators are currently not being monitored: Roughly 40%. That is A LOT.

On that note, the UN has actually [categorized indicators into three tiers](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/tier-classification/):

>  Tier Classification Criteria/Definitions:  
> **Tier 1**: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, and data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant.  
> **Tier 2**: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, but data are not regularly produced by countries.  
> **Tier 3**: No internationally established methodology or standards are yet available for the indicator, but methodology/standards are being (or will be) developed or tested.

And they say that "the updated tier classification contains 101 Tier I indicators, 91 Tier II indicators and 34 Tier III indicators."
Hmmm... But they are working on methodology for assessing the tier 3 indicators.

Continuing my Google searched yielded another result:
[SDG Index & Dashboard](https://sdgindex.org/).
An annual report focused
on identifying each countries' progress and gaps. The outcomes are beautifully
arranged into [their interactive dashboard](https://dashboards.sdgindex.org/).

For each country, it shows their performance on every single one of the 17 SDGs:
Have they achieved it? Are they on track to achieve it? Is their progress reversing?

When you click on one of the SDGs, it even shows progress on each indicator for
the goal.

This is a perfect starting point for me to understand where we are currently at
in our work towards achievement of the SDGs. I will definitely be coming back
to this.

*Side note: I don't quite understand why it says "Significant challenges remain"
for SDG 15 for Germany, but then the trend claims "maintaining SDG achievement".
I'll reach out to the authors and see what's up with that.*

The last note-worthy resource I found were so-called National Reporting Platforms (NRPs):
Separate websites, each run by an individual country to report their own SDG data.

I stumbled across four countries &mdash;
[the US](https://gsa.github.io/sdg-indicators-usa/),
[the UK](https://onsdigital.github.io/sdg-indicators/),
[Rwanda](https://sustainabledevelopment-rwanda.github.io/), and
[Armenia](https://armstat.github.io/sdg-site-armenia/reporting-status/) &mdash;
using an open-source self-reporting platform.
It's a good place to find data on each of the targets. However, it is quite
difficult to see whether a target has been achieved, is on track to being
achieved, or is on track to miss the mark.
That said, it's all open source, so you can actually get involved and help make
these platforms better. You can find them on GitHub.
Seems like [the UK's repository](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-indicators) is seeing the most activity at the moment.

[Australia has a different, closed-source (?) website](https://www.sdgdata.gov.au/)
that shows data on the SDGs &mdash; but, again, it is very difficult to
evaluate progress.

Lastly, there is
[progress reporting for Asia and the Pacific by UN ESCAP](http://data.unescap.org/#progress),
but with limited details.

I actually learned that this self-reporting of data by every countries
is the UN's official strategy for monitoring SDG progress:

> On 6 July 2017, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a global indicator framework to monitor the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a voluntary and country-led endeavour.
> &mdash; [The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2018, p. 16](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/report/2018/TheSustainableDevelopmentGoalsReport2018-EN.pdf)

Okay, that's it for now. I'll let those resources marinate in my head for a while. Be back soon!
