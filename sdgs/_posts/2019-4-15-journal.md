Welcome to my 2nd journal!

It's September 2015. 150+ world leaders have gathered in New York. They are here
to agree on a list of objectives to guide the development of the world for the next 15 years.

This list of objectives becomes knows as the
[17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs).
The goals range from ending poverty to tackling climate change. A greatly
ambitious endeavor.

My goal in life has always been to contribute to a world that works for all,
people and planet. The UN's SDGs are the best description of such a world that
I have seen to date.

So I am starting this journal to better understand the SDGs. And to seek answers
to question like these:

- Is the work of the UN limited to setting goals? Or is there a blueprint for how we (as a world) will achieve the SDGs?
- Are we on track to achieve the SDGs (by 2030)? Who is tracking progress?
- For each goal, which countries are making progress? Which are regressing?
- For each goal and country, what are the key obstacles to achieving the targets?
- For each obstacle, who are the key players working to overcome these challenges?
- How can I be useful in all of this?

Do you have any thoughts? [I would love to hear from you](https://twitter.com/FinnWoelm)!
