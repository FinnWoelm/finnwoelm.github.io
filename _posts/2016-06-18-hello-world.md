## Welcome to my website!
Kudos to you for reading my very first blog post ever.
It's an honor that you are here.

## So what's this site gonna be like?
Well, first off: I am not a writer. Back in school, I dreaded writing assignments.
But now, every once in a while I am overcome by a desire to put some thoughts on
paper: Ideas, random snippets of information, book summaries, cat videos, the usual...

And so - unacceptably infrequently but totally shameless -, I will publish a new post
on this site.

## Wow, that sounds terrible. Why am I spending my time here?
Probably because I asked you to go check out my blog and now you feel compelled to
spend at least 30 seconds reading something. Hey, but you've made it so far.
Here is a special reward just for you: [Congratulations][seahorse-video]!

## What if I want to stay updated on what happens here?
Oh, yay, please stay nearby! Staying updated is pretty easy: If you use an RSS
reader, you can simply [subscribe to my RSS feed here][rss-feed]. Otherwise, just
[follow me on Twitter @FinnWoelm][twitter] because I post there everytime a new blog
post goes live.

## Ok, bye!
Have an absolutely splendid day :)
