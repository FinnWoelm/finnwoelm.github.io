Recently, I came across a bunch of [very 'untraditional' resumes](http://www.minyanville.com/trading-and-investing/personal-finance/articles/10-Non-Traditional-Resumes-To-Take/1/30/2013/id/47726)
and I thought to myself: What would my untraditional resume look like?

So I decided to try myself on something that communicates my love for code.
Here we go:
