            I'd like to live in a world where everyone is treated equally regardless of their gender, race, sexual orientation, religious belief or disability.<br><br>I'd like to live in a world where nurses are paid what they're worth and not what we can get away with paying them.<br><br>I'd like to live in a world where prostitutes and drug dealers didn't exist, not because we'd outlawed them but because their services weren't required.<br><br>I'd like to live in a world which has eradicated poverty and dedicated time and resources to getting literacy levels as close to 100% as possible.<br><br>I'd like to live in a world with no advertising industry, nobody that described themselves as "a public relations consultant" and about 5% of the lawyers we have currently.<br><br>I'd like to live in a world that had worked out what causes people to sexually molest infants and done something to stop it.<br><br>I'd like to live in a world in which Jerry Garcia, Frank Zappa, Nick Drake, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, SRV, Lennon and Harrison weren't dead.<br><br>I'd like to live in a world in which nobody has an argument about who is a terrorist and who is a freedom fighter because there is no need for either to exist.
