          <p>
            A world that is based on the lyrics of John Lennon’s Imagine is ideal, but it seems like something that won’t happen in my lifetime. <br><br>Here’s my (hopefully – but maybe not at all - more realistic) version.<br>I would like to live in a world where:<br><br>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People assume that other people are inherently good, unless proven otherwise. Or at least, where people are neutral to another person unless they have very strong reason to be hostile. The current norm seems to be guilty until proven innocent, and not the opposite. A change in this mindset would save a lot of unnecessary negativity and - to put it crudely - bullshit. <br><br>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We move beyond stereotypes of geographical location, gender, religion, caste, etc. The only reason why these stereotypes still seem to be quite valid is because people haven’t found the courage or the will to move beyond them. And this will to be a good human being first, and everything else later, is the most important thing we can achieve as a race. <br><br>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People are not as quick to form judgements about people as they are right now. <br><br>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People spend less time trying to change other people than they spend trying to change themselves. Enough said.<br><br>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People worry less about tomorrow, and live happily today. <br><br>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People are given the resources to maximise their potential.
