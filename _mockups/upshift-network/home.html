    We want to live in a world where you can communicate with people from all networks.

            Many of us use social networks every day: To stay in touch with friends,
            to collaborate, to work, to follow the news.
            <br/><br/>
            Social networks have become so important in our lives,
            some are seeking networks that are transparent, open, ad-free,
            for-purpose, democratic, and protective of their privacy,
