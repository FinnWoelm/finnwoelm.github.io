Today is my 26th birthday. Not too long ago, I could never imagine myself being
older than 25. Now, I'm 26. And I cannot imagine myself ever being 30 years old.

Anyway &mdash; birthdays are always great opportunities for reflection. A lot of
that belongs in my personal diary and not in this journal. But Openly is a major
part of my life and so I want to take note of something that stands out to me in
this regard:

I miss making people smile through the work that I do. I miss being a source of
joy or happiness in people's life. I miss making a difference with my work.

It is, I believe, a natural characteristic of this hybrid impact-profit startup
that it takes a looooong time for us to get to a place where we can witness the
fruits of our labor (especially the impact ones).

So here then is my goal for my 27th year on this planet: Figure out how Openly
can bring smiles to people's faces, even if it's just in little ways &mdash;
because we provide them with the best customer service they have ever
experienced, because animations in our application are cute, or because using
Openly allows them to get work done faster and spend more time on the things
that do make them smile (but even then, I'd love for Openly to directly cause
little smiles to).
