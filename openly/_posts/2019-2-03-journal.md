Hard to believe we've been at Antler for just two weeks. It feels like so much
has been happening.

After a lot of activities and sessions the previous week, we got back to working
on Openly this week. It is absolutely wonderful to get back into work after such
a long break (since mid November, more or less).

Here are some highlights from the past days:

- **Daily existential crises**:
  It feels that every day we have at least one moment in which we question
  everything that we are doing. It usually does not hit Jessy and me at the
  same time, so we can support each other and balance it out.

  The crises are often caused by becoming aware of all the
  uncertainties that we are facing: Is this going to work? Does anyone want
  this? Will anyone want to pay for this? Are we qualified to do this? Are we
  walking in circles? Will this really make a difference in the world?
  What's the point of all this? Is the light in the fridge
  on when the door is closed?

- **Tyler, our dedicated coach from Antler**:
  One of the perks of participating in the Antler program is that every startup
  team gets assigned one dedicated coach. Our coach is Tyler, an entrepreneur
  and intrapreneur with experience in a variety of fields &mdash; he is
  extremely smart and super awesome. On top of all that, he also cares about
  having a positive impact in the world.

  We already had our first session with Tyler a few days ago and he helped us
  work through our existential crisis that day. He kept asking us questions to
  help us dig deeper into the problems that we are trying to tackle and recorded
  everything neatly on the wall:

  Tyler is awesome.

  Thanks, Tyler!

- **Our Reddit post that interested exactly 1 person**:
  We hypothesized that Reddit could be a good place for finding early adopters
  because its users tend to be pretty tech-savy. So we launched [a video post in
  the r/GoogleDrive subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleDrive/comments/aknl7k/git_for_google_drive_feedback/).
  We got one response. Not exactly a breakthrough
  in terms of user acquisition, but hey, everyone counts!

- **The launch of the pull requests feature**:
  After working on it far too long (and violating the "release frequently,
  release early" mantra), we finally released the first implementation of our
  pull request feature. In the spirit of de-jargonizing everything, we are
  calling this feature 'Contributions'.

  What exactly is a contribution? It's a process for suggesting changes to
  one or multiple files. The key idea is that rather than suggesting the changes
  in the original files and mixing finished work and work-in-progress, it is
  better to suggest these changes in *copies* of the original files.

  The contributions feature makes this process really painless. When a user
  creates a contribution, it automatically creates an isolated workspace with
  one copy of each files that the user can then edit to their heart's desire.
  When changes have been made, they can be reviewed by the project team. A
  review page, that shows all changes made by the user, makes this process
  extremely frustration-free. At the click of a single button, the suggested
  changes can be accepted and merged into the original files. Or, the changes
  can be rejected and the user be prompted to make further adjustments and
  changes prior to merge.

- **The refreshing new look of our landing page**:
  The last time we touched our landing page was in October last year.
  Since then, we have
  iterated many times upon the problem that we're tackling and the words we use
  to describe it. And we wanted to go for something that looks modern and
  professional. I quite like the end result &mdash; what do you think?

- **An experiment &mdash; our first ad**:
  In an attempt to quickly validate our value proposition (offering a
  GitHub-like experience for documents), we decided to take a hundred dollars
  and launch our first ever ad. We decided to advertise on Facebook because we
  could target specific job roles (product managers) with specific interests
  (GitHub and Google Drive or Box or OneDrive). We just launched the ad, so it's
  too early to say anything about performance.

Alright, back to work!
