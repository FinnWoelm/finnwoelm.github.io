Jessy got three people to request early access via our form today. Wooho!

I'm gaining ground on the contributions/pull requests feature. Users can now
create pull requests, which copies over all files from the last commit, and
then browse through files. Next, I need to refactor some of our application
logic and then add force-syncing & file restore for contributions. And then
review & accept/merge and discussions.

Last but not least: Antler told us that they finally submitted our EntrePass
application. It could take up to eight weeks. Fingers crossed that it will
process in time!

**Mood:** Excited for work tomorrow!  
**Happiness:** 6/5
