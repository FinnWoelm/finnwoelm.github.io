Pull requests are starting to take shape. We have index and create actions
implemented as well as the setup of the pull request (we need to copy all files
from master branch into a new fork and provide the pull request creator with
edit access).

We now need:

1. files tab for browsing folders & files (without capture changes button)
1. review tab for seeing the list of changes & accepting (merging) it
1. discussion tab for discussing the pull request

In other news, the open.ly domain name has been renewed (it had expired a couple
days ago, but was still far from being open to outside purchase [read more about
[the domain lifecycle](https://www.domainsherpa.com/understanding-the-domain-name-lifecycle/)])
. That's bad news. The good news: The domain owner has replied to our email. He
called our offer "not terrible" (whatever that means... :)) and said that he
would get back to us soon.
