Itâ€™s been Thanksgiving week, so not much is new. On Monday, we set up our analytics dashboard to help us track usage of Openly.

Now, we have more or less three weeks left before Jessy and I both take off for our respective homes. We are focused on bringing 10 more users on board and launching the pull request feature (which has been highly requested).

**Mood:** exhausted x_x (still recovering from my camping trip this week)  
**Happiness:** 4/5
