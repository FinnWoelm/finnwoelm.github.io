After a slow period (due to all the guests we have been hosting + Thanksgiving),
we're now getting back into the grind. Jessy recruited some more potential
users today.

We're now at 10 users although we don't have anyone actively using
our platform. It's a problem. We'd really like to find one active user before
the year ends and I'm not sure if that's going to happen if things continue the
way the are. So... let's step up the game!

**Mood:** Eager to find that 1 active user!  
**Happiness:** 4/5
