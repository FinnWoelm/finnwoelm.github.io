The world is awesome.

Jessy and I spent the past two weeks reaching out to open initiatives from all
over the world.

> **What are open initiatives?**  
> Organizations, community-run projects, government agencies, or startups that
do all of their work in the open and invite anyone to contribute.

We learned about
[Open Source Malaria](https://opensourcemalaria.org) where dozens of researchers
are openly collaborating on finding a cure to malaria. We talked to
[Precious Plastic](https://preciousplastic.com/), an community-run initiative of
engineers, activists, and hobbyist who have been designing and building machines
for recycling plastic waste. And just last night we talked to the Government of
Canada which is pioneering an
[Open Government Initiative](https://open.canada.ca/en).

This is just a small selection of the amazing work done by people all over the
world. There are so many more, like
[Open Music Initiative](http://open-music.org/),
[WikiHouse](https://wikihouse.cc/), and
[Open Science MOOC](https://opensciencemooc.eu/).

It's inspiring. Hundreds of people working in the open to make the world a
better place. Not in it for the money or the credit, it's all about solving the
problem at hand. Who cares if it's you or me who solves it? Fact is that we'll
all be better off if we openly share our findings and put our brains together.

Incredibly inspiring. Yes, open collaboration still niche. But I like to imagine
that one day, open and collaborative will the standard. Political participation
will no longer be limited to voting, but citizens will be involved in the
crafting of laws and policies at every level. Ordinary citizens' engagement with
non-profits will no longer be just donations and signing petitions online, but
direct involvement with the issues.

Eventually, even corporations will &mdash; at least partially &mdash; adopt open
collaboration and allow their stakeholders to be active participants in the
creation of their products. We're already seeing this with Google, Apple, and
Microsoft in open source software, but we will start seeing it in other domains
of business, like food and beverage, personal care products, and manufacturing.

Open is not just a nice-to-have, it's a necessity if we want
to successfully tackle the world's biggest challenges. Let's just make sure it
happens soon enough. &#x1F4AA;
