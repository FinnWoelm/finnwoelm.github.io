Long day. Let's just put it out there: TODAY WAS MAGICAL.

Reading that you might think that our lunch with Google Drive was a huge success.
Well, it wasn't. Or rather, our lunch was fine but our conversation really went
downhill. We started talking and within 15 minutes, we had maneuvered the
conversation into them recommending that we spend time really figuring out
whether we're trying to help social entrepreneurs (in which case, we should do
something that actually solves their problems) or pushing a technology.

To be fair, they have a point. It's just frustrating because it reminds me of
most of our conversations last year and I had (mistakenly) believed that we had
moved past this. Well, here we go again. This time, though, Jessy and I want to
really figure out how to move beyond this. We have some ideas (more on that
later).

A highlight from our conversation: They said they'd be happy to open up any API
endpoints that we need &#x1F632; AMAZING!

Lastly, I just had a really magical moment a couple minutes ago as I was
drafting an email to one of the folks from Google Drive about the API endpoints
we would like access to. I was writing about a feature that we would love to see
added to Google Drive:

> On another note, we've been looking for a way to give comment access to a
folder + its files. For an Open Source project, comment-only access would be the
perfect sharing setting. But folders only support view OR edit access.
> [Our startup, Openly, is 70% open source](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2ioM1QJEE9kcVJoYU9jZEZqa2s)
but our files are view-only because manually setting each file to comment access
is a real hassle. Is there a good workaround?

Anyone who's tried to provide comment access to a folder & its files knows this
problem. You can share folders with view or edit access only.

So as I'm writing that email draft, I'm thinking that I should at least try this
via the API:

)

AND IT WORKS! WOW. [Our Openly Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2ioM1QJEE9kcVJoYU9jZEZqa2s) now in fact has public comment access! Comment away folks! Magic does happen :)
