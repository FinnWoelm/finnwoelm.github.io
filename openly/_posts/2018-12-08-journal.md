Apologies for the radio silence. Things are a little crazy over here.

Let me sum things up:
- Jessy got back from San Francisco on Tuesday morning
- We booked our flights to Singapore. We'll be arriving Tue, Jan 15
- Jessy estimated our conversation rate for user acquisition:
  - 30% of people use Google Drive
  - Of those who use Drive, 70% of people find Openly "interesting" (i.e. like
    the concept)
  - Of those who find it interesting, 10% have an actual use case for Openly
    (i.e. Openly would solve a problem that they currently have)
  - In sum, out of ever 100 people we talk to, just about 2 will actually sign
    up for our beta (0.3 * 0.7 * 0.1 = 0.021)
  - That said, this is all estimation. We realized we need to do a better job
    tracking conversion rates. And we also need to track key characteristics of
    those users (such as team size, whether they work remotely, profession,
    etc...) so that we can form a data-based hypothesis about our early adopter
    group.
- We implemented side-by-side diffs. It allows you to see a document's content
  change from one revision to another side by side: Old content on the left,
  new content on the right. It looks very straightforward but it was incredibly
  complex to implement because we ran into limitations with our diffing utility
  `dwdiff`. I hope to write a blog post on that, stay tuned.

- We now have 10 days left in CO. Those days are filled with A LOT of meetings
  with mentors and friends. We're also meeting a lot of new people because if
  they live in Colorado, then this is our last chance to meet with them
  face-to-face.
- In addition to all the meetings, we're also pushing harder than ever to reach
  our semester goal of getting to one active user before the end of the year.
  Jessy is hustling to find potential users (and she's finding them on an almost
  daily basis) and I'm pushing to get pull requests out the door.

240 hours left. Let's do this.
