Getting real on Reddit.

Things haven't been going so well. Not that things have been particularly bad in
recent times, but more so that things have never really been going all that well
to begin with. We're 18 months into Openly and we ~~still don't have any users~~
have one active user. Meh.

It's frustrating. And more than that, it's paralyzing. As I wrote in the last
post, we have an existential crisis every day. Do you know what that means? We
spend every day agonizing over whether we're doing things right or not and how
we should be approaching things and worrying about whether it will work out or
not. But we don't actually do anything because we spend all of our time
worrying.

So Friday, out of desperation, I decided to write a post on Reddit. I suck at
faking success (and I'm tired of pretending), so I went the other way and
[wrote honestly about our struggles and frustrations](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/aofu8n/what_would_you_like_to_see_in_a_github_for/).

Six hours later, we're the hottest topic in the 60k member strong
r/opensource subreddit:

Before you get too excited: Most of the commenters were pretty skeptical about
the viability of Openly. Lots of great insights, though, as well as some
promising new connections with people who may want to get involved. We also
doubled our website traffic and our waitlist signups (more on that as well as
the performance of our Facebook ad generally in a couple days).
