We've made it to Singapore! It's warm and humid here. I'm still trying to wrap
my mind around the idea that we will be living here for the next 2+ months.
Quite exciting!

We spent all day running around the city looking for housing. Looks like we'll
be based in [Chinatown](http://www.chinatown.sg/) because that's walking distance from the [Collision8 coworking space that Antler operates out of](https://www.collision8.com/).
It means I'll have great opportunities to practice my Chinese. But it also means
I won't be living in Little India with all its delicious Indian food :'(

From what we've seen so far, it looks like we'll live in a hostel for the next
two months. Jessy found this amazing hostel called
[Tribe Theory](https://tribetheory.com/) for entrepreneurs. As we walked by
yesterday, the founder swung by. He is really well connected, the place has a
great vibe, and they offered us a significantly
discounted rate. What's not to love? :)

Tomorrow, we will do our 2018-end-of-year reflection and set goals for the next
couple months.

And I can't wait to get back to work!
