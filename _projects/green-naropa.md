  Inspiring people to take small actions to reduce their climate footprint. And
  providing them with the resources they need to successfully do so.

The idea for Green Naropa was born late in 2015: Every year, people form resolutions
about changes they want to make in their lives or goals they want to accomplish. If
we made it easy and fun, could climate actions not easily be part of that list, too?

## Objectives

### Inspire Small Actions

### Provide Tips and Resources

### Make a Commitment

## Distribution Strategy
To spread awareness of the site, we put up twenty posters around the three
Naropa campuses. The posters came in four different varieties (see Posters
below) and were printed poster-size to be more eye-catching.

In addition, we worked with Naropa University, the Naropa Sustainability
Council, and the Student Union of Naropa &mdash; all of which shared a link
to Green Naropa on their Facebook pages.

Lastly, we attempted to encourage word-of-mouth propagation by making it easy
and convenient to share one's climate commitment goals on Facebook, Twitter, and
Google+.
