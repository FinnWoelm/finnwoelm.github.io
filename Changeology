## How to Enable Groups, Communities, and Societies to Do Things They've Never Done Before
by **Les Robinson** (2012. UK: Green Books.)

# Six ingredients of change
1. Start a buzz: Change runs on conversation and interaction. Surprise+emotion is the key to stimulating buzz.
1. Offer hope: Humans are motivated to live closer to their dreams and hopes. The proper role for a change maker is not to try to change people's hopes but rather to design change efforts which help people realize the positive, healthy hopes they already have.
1. Creating an enabling environment: Every behavior is enabled or disabled by the day-to-day environments in which people make their choices. The most powerful changes are likely to be those that build communities and create ease.
1. Design a sticky solution: Deliver a solution that builds on people's universal desires for time, control, and self-esteem, while at the same time achieving larger social or environmental gains. To do so means thinking like a designer, spending time with people, and becoming intimately acquainted with their lives, struggles, and frustrations. Remember that reinvention is what drives solutions across social systems.
1. Expand people's comfort zones: Change is scary - every change effort should therefore expand people's comfort zones so they can act on their motivations without fear.
1. Find the right inviter: Who invites an action can be more important than the character of the action itself. The best inviters are passionate, similar, respected, connected, powerless, and believe in the actors' ability to sucessfully implement a change in their lives.

In shorthand, this theory could be written as:
*IF* there's positive buzz
*AND* we offer hope
*AND* an enabling environment
*AND* a sticky solution
*AND* expand comfort zones
*AND* the right inviter
*THEN* people will do things they have never done before and sustain those changes.
